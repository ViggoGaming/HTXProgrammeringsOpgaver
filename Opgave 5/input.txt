Who Was Stanley Tookie Williams?
Stanley Tookie Williams was an American gangster who was deeply immersed in the Los Angeles street life. Williams and a friend created a gang that they called "Crips" and was later arrested and convicted of murder.
Early life
Tookie was born on the 29th of December 1953 to a 17-year-old mother, and he was a troublemaker from the start.

In 1959, when he was only 6 years old, he and his mother moved to Los Angeles, California.
He quickly learned how to deal with the bullies on the street and knew how to defend himself.

He sometimes hung out in abandoned houses in South Central where he would observe drunk adults abuse drugs, gamble, and bet on dog fights.
After the adults finished the dogfighting they would make the children fight each other, and bet on the children.
“Crips”
In 1969 Tookie met Raymond Washington. They formed a sort of “alliance” that they called “Crips”. They originally founded the gang to protect their neighborhood from bigger gangs. Originally “Crips” had 30 members but they divided into two different gangs, the Westside, and Eastside Crips, but by 1979 it had expanded into a statewide organization and they lost control of the group.

In 1979 Tookie and 3 gang members robbed a convenience store, this led to Tookie killing the store clerk.
Jailed
In 1981 Tookie was sent to prison.
After only two years in prison, he started to change his behavior, by for example starting to pray to God and he published a series of books made for young people to get scared of ending up in prison as he did.

In 2005 he was sentenced to a death sentence and was executed by lethal injection on December 13th, 2005, in San Quentin State Prison.
